Dear Amit sir,
I am writing to inform you that I have decided to resign from my position as Customer service executive at Agarwal Packers and Movers Ltd. My last day of work will be 7th of August 2023. I have recently received a better job opportunity in Abu Dhabi that aligns with my career goals and personal growth. Unfortunately, there is one more reason which is due to the toxic work environment that has developed here, I can no longer continue to work for the company.

I have enjoyed my time at Agarwal Packers and Movers Ltd. and am grateful for the opportunity to work with such a talented and dedicated team. However, I have decided to pursue other opportunities that align more closely with my professional goals.There have been some process changes in the last 15 to 20 days that don't make me think I'll continue because I was hired for customer service or now I'm getting a sales job which I don't think is a good fit for me or I am interested in such role where my colleges will criticize me, for not bringing the sales and not hitting the monthly or daily target which leads to create a toxic work environment in the team. 

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help with the transition process, such as completing outstanding work or providing information that will help my replacement to take over my responsibilities. I am committed to fulfilling all of my contractual obligations and ensuring a smooth handover of my work.

@rituhr Mam Please disburse my outstanding salary amount in my same salary account in which it comes till now because now I will not be able to continue further with the position due to above mentioned reasons. Kindlly deactivate all my 	ID's like erp, internet, techinfo, etc. so that the misuses can be avoided.

Thank you again for the opportunity to work at Agarwal Packers and Movers Ltd.. I am proud of the contributions I have made during my time here and wish the company continued success in the future.

Please do not hesitate to contact me at 8076895817 or himanshurawat.skillbee@gmail.com if you have any questions or concerns.


Feedback to the team

Vipin : We got along, worked very productively, you were very supportive and informative senior having solution to all the problems, just a little bit if you could work on your arrogance nature and the offensive things which comes out of your mouth without intention will lead you to achieve success and make a productive and happy work environment.

Sonali : It was a great learning experience with you though we did not interact much but if you will try to be more flexible and understanding you can fly higher and dive more deeper.

Vishal : If you can try not to pinpoint, the juniors can help to create a toxic free environment and everyone knows their job and responsibility. If you can be more, Hubble will create a smooth and happy work environment.

Umesh : It was nice working with you, taking updates from the team is good but you should not criticize and compare others with you. It can be a fresh experience for someone to get hired as a customer care executive and work as a sales employee. I wish you the best in your life.

Pankaj : It was great working with you, if you will take your responsibility more seriously and focus on the things you can be an achiever.

Abhinav : Buddy, try to think a little practical and do not hesitate to put your thoughts in a discussion, wish you the best.

Preeti : You were very supportive and responsible. I am glad to work with you. I wish you success in your life.

Khushboo : With all due respect not everyone is as perfect as you, try to be more understanding and supportive towards the new joiners and not charge on them, you can be more humble and correct the mistakes.


Thank you again for everything.
Sincerely,
Himanshu Rawat
